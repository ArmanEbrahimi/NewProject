        <p>In this page I am going to talk about my favorite genre of music and for each genre I will 
            introduce several artists and for each artist their best works!<br>
            My favorite genre of music is Progressive which itself can be devided into several sub categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="file:///F:/programming/Git/NewProject/MyFavoriteMusics/ProgressiveRock/ProgressiveRock.html">Progressive rock</a> </li>
            <li><a href="file:///F:/programming/Git/NewProject/MyFavoriteMusics/ProgressiveMetal/ProgressiveMetal.html">Progressive Metal</a> </li>
        </ul>
        <p>each of this sub genres also can be divided into sub genres! For instance Progressive Metal can<br>
        be divided into: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Extreme Metal</li>
            <li>Math Metal</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Progressive Rock itself contains sub genres such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Pyschedelic Rock</li>
                <li>Heavy Prog</li>
                <li>Neo Progressive Rock</li>
                <li>Post-Rock</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
