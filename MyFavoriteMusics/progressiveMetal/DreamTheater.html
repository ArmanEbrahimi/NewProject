                The Long Island-based quintet Dream Theater are, in the 21st century, the standard bearers of
                 progressive metal. While the subgenre's origins can be traced to Rush's song "Bastille Day" in 
                 1975, and Queensr√øche's 1988 concept offering Operation: Mindcrime was its first full-length 
                 album, Dream Theater have largely defined and expanded the music's horizons since 1986. The 
                 band's ability to deliver tight, melodic, musically sophisticated songs and thematic concept 
                 recordings that encompass elements of hook-based hard rock, riff-fueled metal, syncopated prog, 
                 and sophisticated lyrics have made them the act that subsequent genre bands aspire to and are 
                 measured by. While five of their albums have charted inside the Top 20 of the Top 200, ten have 
                 placed inside the top half of the chart; they have sold more than 12 million records globally. 
                 The recording that initially established their signature was second album 1992's Images and 
                 Words, while 1994's Awake, 1999's Metropolis, Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory, and 2002's Six Degrees of 
                 Inner Turbulence cemented their place at the top of the metal heap. For 2016's The Astonishing -- a 
                 double-length dystopian sci-fi opera that reached the Top 20 on the albums chart -- they were 
                 accompanied by the Prague Symphony Orchestra and three choirs. Dream Theater is known for its high-
                 energy concert performances, and while they've released several live albums -- Live at the Marquee, 
                 recorded at the London club; Live in Japan, recorded during the Music in Progress tour in 1993; and 
                 Live Scenes from New York -- they remain one of heavy metal's most bootlegged bands.
