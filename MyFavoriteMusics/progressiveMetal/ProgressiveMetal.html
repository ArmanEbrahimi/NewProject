        <p><h4>Definition</h4>
            This category represents the core movement of what is called "Progressive Metal" in the literal sense.
             It is a subgenre of progressive rock as much as it is a subgenre of heavy metal, and this is how its 
             sound is defined: a blend of heavy, guitar-oriented metal music enriched with compositional innovation 
             and complex arrangements, usually expressed through diverse instrumentation and often (but not always) 
             with odd-time signatures. Common, but not essential to define the movement, are the frequent use of 
             keyboards, high-pitched vocals, concept lyrical themes and tracks of longer duration. Similar to 
             progressive rock, progressive metal draws influences from other genres, such as jazz/fusion, ethnic, 
             classical and symphonic music

        <header><h4>The Origin</h4></header>
        <p>
            The heavy sound of some of the progressive rock bands of the 70's has been one of the building
             blocks on which progressive metal was raised. Progressive rock pioneers such as KING CRIMSON and 
             RUSH have often been acclaimed as the main influences of progressive metal bands. The other major
              influence has been the NWOBHM (New Wave of British Heavy Metal) movement, and especially the 
              twin-guitar arrangements of IRON MAIDEN, which have left their stamp on the early stages of the 
              genre's development.
